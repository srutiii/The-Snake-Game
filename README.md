# The-Snake-Game
This is a simple snake game built using Python's Turtle graphics library. The game features a snake that grows in length as it consumes food, with the player controlling the snake's direction using the arrow keys. The goal is to eat as much food as possible without colliding with the walls or the snake's own body. The game keeps track of the player's score, which increases with each piece of food eaten. It also includes game over logic when the snake collides with a wall or itself. The game offers a fun and engaging experience for players of all ages.

## How to Play:
 - Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction.
 - Eat the food (yellow circles) to grow the snake and increase your score.
 - Avoid colliding with the walls or the snake's own body.
 - The game ends when the snake collides with a wall or itself.
